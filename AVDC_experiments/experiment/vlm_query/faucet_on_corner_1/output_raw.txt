### Explanation:
1. **Stage 1 (Grasping)**:
   - The robot grasps the red faucet by its body.
   - Function: `stage_1_subgoal_constraint1()`

2. **Stage 2 (Rotating the Faucet)**:
   - **Target Constraint**: The red faucet must rotate around its axis by at least 100 degrees.
   - **Path Constraint**: The center of the gripper must remain at the same distance from the center of the faucet during the rotation.
   - Functions: `stage_2_target_constraint1()` and `stage_2_path_constraint1()`

3. **Stage 3 (Releasing)**:
   - The robot releases the red faucet.
   - Function: `stage_3_subgoal_constraint1()`
