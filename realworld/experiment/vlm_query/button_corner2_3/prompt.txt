- To find out the heading direction of long-shaped object, find the max PCA component.
- To find out the normal of a surface / plane, find the min PCA component.
- To rotate something around a given axis, you may need to compute the rotation matrix using Rodrigues' rotation formula
- If point A is `x` cm along the normal of surface B:
    - calculate mean of B as mean_B
    - calculate normal of B as normal_B
    - the cost should be L2 distance of point_A - mean_B + normal_B * x

## Instructions
Suppose you are controlling a robot to perform manipulation tasks by writing constraint functions in Python. The manipulation task is given as an image of the environment. For each given task, please perform the following steps:
- Determine how many stages are involved in the task. Grasping or releasing must be an independent stage. Some examples:
  - "pouring tea from teapot":
    - 3 stages: "grasp teapot", "align teapot with cup opening", and "pour liquid"
  - "put red block on top of blue block":
    - 3 stages: "grasp red block", "drop the red block on top of blue block"
  - "reorient bouquet and drop it upright into vase":
    - 3 stages: "grasp bouquet", "reorient bouquet", and "keep upright and drop into vase"
- For each stage except for the grasping and release stage, please write geometric constraints in lines. Each line represent a constraint should be satisfied. Each line is a tuple of multiple element: ("constraints type", "`geometry 1` of `the object part` of `the object` (timestamp), "`geometry 2` of `the object part` of `the object` (timestamp), ...(if any),  "constraints"), each element is explained in the follows:
  - "geometry":  Basic geometric primitive like the left edge, the center point, the plane, the normal, the right area, and etc..
  - "the object part": the key object part on an object, like the tip, the opening, the handle, the hinge, the slider, the gripper, etc.
  - "the object": the complete object, like the black cup, the second door, the teapot, the robot, etc.
  - "constraint": 
    - 1. basic geometric relationship including parallel, perpendicular, vertical, intersect, and etc.. 
    - 2. positional constraint like above, below, to the left / right, and etc.. 
    - 3. Distance range like "by 10 centimeters", "around 10 centimeters", "more than 25 centimeters", "10 centimeters to 20 centimeters", "45 degress", etc..
    - 4. Transformation like "rotate", "shift", etc.
  - Specify the <`geometry` of `the object part` of `the object`> in the "constraint"
  - "timestamp":
    - By default, if (timestamp) is not specified, the `geometry` if always referred at the latest position.
    - If you want to specify that the geometry at its initial position, you can say "at its initial timestamp".
  - "constraints type": 
    - "targets constraints": `geometry 1`, ... are transformed according to the `constraints`, and the result is pre-computed as the target. The `geometry` should align with the target **at the end of the stage**.
    - "sub-goal constraints": constraints among `geometry 1`, `geometry 2`, ... that must be satisfied **at the end of the stage**.
    - "path constraints": constraints among `geometry 1`, `geometry 2`, ... that must be satisfied **within the stage**. 
  - Strictly follow the format. Do not ignore "of". There must of two "of": "`geometry` of `the object part` of `the object`". If you what to specify `geometry` of the whole object, use `geometry` of the body of `the object`
- For the grasping stage, output <"grasp", "the area of `the object part` of `the object`">
- To close the gripper only without grasping anything, output <"grasp", "">
- If you want to use the gripper, only specify its center position.
- For the releasing stage, output <"release">
- Avoid using the part that is invisible in the image like "bottom", "back part" and etc.
- Please give as detailed constraint as possible.
- To move something, you must grasp it first.
- Each stage can only do a single action one time.
- The path constraint and sub-goal constraint in the last stage can be the path constraint in the previous stage, unless the constraint should not hold anymore.
- Don't omit stages for the repeating stages, expand and list them one by one.

Summarize a list of "`geometry` of `the object part` of `the object`" that we need to track. For example:
  - "pouring liquid from teapot":
  part_lists = ["the center of handle of the teapot", "the center of spout of the teapot", "the plane of the cup opening of the cup", "the center of the cup opening of the cup", "the plane of the surface of the table"]
num_stages = ?
<STEP SPLITTER>



We can obtain the segmentation mask by calling Python function "segment('`geometry` of `the object part` of `the object`', `timestamp`)".
  - we record the position of the `geometry` since the grasping / contact stage, and record it into array.
  - specify `timestamp` to retrive `geometry` mask at the given timestamp. For example, timestamp = -2 to retrieve the last mask at the time of grasping. timestamp = -1 to retrieve the current mask.
  - Example 1, if I want to segment "the axis of the body of the windmill" at its current timestamp, I can obtain the mask by  "mask = segment('the axis of the body of the windmill', -1)". 
  - Example 2, if I want to segment "the plane of the surface of the door" at its last timestamp, I can obtain the mask by "mask = segment('the plane of the surface of the door', -2)".
- We have another function called "mask_to_pc" which can retrieve the point cloud in the shape N by 3 of the segment part. 
- Please implement a Python function "stage_i_subgoal_constraints()", "stage_i_path_constraints()" or "stage_i_target_constraints" for all the constraints tuples in the <> brackets one by one, except for the grasping and repleasing constraints. It returns the cost measuring to what extent the constraint is satisfied. The constraint is satisfied when the cost goes down to 0. 
- Grasping, and releasing should be a seperate stage. For grasping, directly return grasp(geometry of `the object part` of `the object`). For releasing, directly return release().
- We also have a function called release() to release the object. For the releasing stage, directly call the release function.
- Please directily generate the Python code. 
- constraint codes of each stage are splitted by a line "### <stage constraints splitter> ###"
- the unit of length is meter.
- The stage start from 1.
- If it's angle constraint related to parallel or perpendicular, multiply the cost by 5.
- List as much constraints as possible. Inspect whether there is a constraint between each pair of objects.
- Don't omit stages for the repeating stages, expand and list them one by one.
